This study proposes a deep learning-based SSVEP classification model, ConvFormer, aiming to enhance the performance of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The model combines a global Fourier transform encoder and a local convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder, leveraging the strengths of CNNs and Transformers in feature extraction. Through data preprocessing and feature extraction, the model excels in handling SSVEP signals. In experiments, the ConvFormer model outperforms existing methods in classification accuracy and information transfer rate on two public SSVEP datasets (Tsinghua University dataset and University of San Diego dataset), particularly in short time windows. Ablation studies show that both the CNN and Transformer components are crucial, and removing either results in significant performance degradation. t-SNE clustering results further validate the model's effectiveness in feature extraction and classification tasks. In summary, the ConvFormer model demonstrates innovation in theory and proves its strong performance and broad applicability in practical applications, promising to advance SSVEP-BCI technology.
